# Overview

This project is a **GIF Explorer** web app that lets you search the GIPHY catalog and browse trending content. I built it to practice DOM manipulation, async JavaScript, and working with a public REST API.

Users can search via the input or use preset tags for one-click queries. Results render as responsive cards with titles and lazy-loaded images, and the app shows helpful states for loading or empty searches.

The goal is to strengthen front-end fundamentals while delivering a polished, single-page experience that can run from a simple static server.
